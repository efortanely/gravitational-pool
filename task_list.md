- improve momentum transfer between balls
- clumps of balls behave like singular mass
- more dramatic gravity (stronger closer in and weaker further away)
- balls should stop moving after a time threshold each turn so they don't fall back into each other over time
- less friction should cause space but not too little so
- cue trajectory should curve around balls
  - hitting cue ball with multiple angles and (x, y) positions
  - add spin hits to balls
- orbiting
- balls should always spin like planets
- sphere of influence indicators for gravity
- add indicator for direction and force of hitting cue ball
- fix overlap detection for the pockets and balls to determine if ball sunk
